this function will accept the position of the current cell to check

the first thing it will do:

if that position is not a 0 square, then reveal that position and return the function, breaking the recursive loop

otherwise continue and reveal that square. 

find positions of each of the surrounding cells

go through those with a [for (let x of array)] loop, calling this function with each of these positions
