first click:

get all buttons to have the following classes:
- clicked or unclicked
- displayed or hidden
- contains mine (yes/no)
- num of mines touching 

upon first click, if num of mines is 0 then check 8 surrounding buttons for their num of mines touching

repeat process for all neighbouring buttons that do not touch any mines (AND ARE NOT YET DISPLAYED) until for all buttons displayed, num of mines touching is at least 1 (ie complete border of numbers)

from this point, gameplay is essentially already coded
